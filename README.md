## Deep Learning
## Fashion-MNIST 
- It is a dataset of Zalandoâ€™s article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. It is split into 10,000 as a test and 50,000 as train datasets. Although the dataset is relatively simple, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification from scratch.

## Steps in the notebook:
1. data preprocessing.
2. le-Net 5 model.
3. Modify hyperparameters to get the best performance with a tuner.
4. Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation
5. other two CNN models (using transfer learning):
    - ResNet152V2 model.
    - VGG16 model.
